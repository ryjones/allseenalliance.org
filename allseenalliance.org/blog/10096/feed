    &lt;p&gt;It’s been an especially exciting couple of weeks for the AllSeen Alliance, with a flurry of important activity. Part of that has to do with IFA (pronounced “ee-fa”), a huge trade show for consumer electronics and home appliances. IFA officially is taking place in Berlin Sept. 5-10, but as is the case every year, the days leading up to the show were chock-a-block with news announcements. The AllSeen Alliance was in the thick of things with the joining of two new Premier Members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.electroluxappliances.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://i58.tinypic.com/2w3au1i.jpg&quot; style=&quot;float:right; height:140px; width:200px&quot; /&gt;Electrolux&lt;/a&gt; – the world’s second largest appliance maker, with brands including Electrolux, AEG, Zanussi, Eureka, Frigidaire, Molteni and Westinghouse – &lt;a href=&quot;https://allseenalliance.org/announcement/electrolux-joins-allseen-alliance-premier-member&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;became the Alliance’s 10th Premier Member&lt;/a&gt;. Electrolux recognizes the potential of appliances communicating with each other and with other devices in a connected home but, according to Chief Technology Officer Jan Brockmann, “we also recognize that making this reality requires major players from across industries to come together and make sure devices and systems can work together seamlessly regardless of brand.” &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloomberg.com/video/embed/OK1PUALTSuW2gJ5hmYn2XQ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Electrolux believes the AllSeen Alliance is that venue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://i61.tinypic.com/33lz7m0.png&quot; style=&quot;float:left; height:140px; margin:10px; width:200px&quot; /&gt;Less than a week later, &lt;a href=&quot;https://allseenalliance.org/announcement/allseen-alliance-announces-sony-premier-member&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sony threw its support behind the Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and became the 11th Premier Member, bringing the total number of members to 64 since the Alliance was established in December 2013. Sony is a big believer in the power of open source development to foster innovative audio, video, communications and technology products for the Internet of Everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AllSeen Alliance’s member roster now includes the No. 1 and No. 2 global market share leaders in appliances (Haier and Electrolux); the world&#039;s largest software company (Microsoft); the Big Three Japanese electronics makers (Sharp, Sony and Panasonic); smart TV, electronics, appliance and telecommunications giant LG; the No. 1 company in mobile chipsets (Qualcomm), the largest manufacturer of WLAN equipment TP-link and other leaders like Silicon Image and Technicolor. Not to mention the broad cross-section of electronics manufacturers, appliance makers, service providers, retailers, automotive and enterprise technology companies and cool startups that comprise our Community Members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As AllSeen chairwoman Liat Ben-Zur &lt;a href=&quot;https://allseenalliance.org/news/blogs/2014/07/open-source-community-internet-everything-interoperability&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recently said&lt;/a&gt;, “Interoperability cannot be achieved in a fragmented industry, and the Internet of Everything doesn’t work unless the “everything” works together.” It takes a truly open and collaborative approach from companies in a wide breadth of industries to move this market forward -- and that’s what we’re doing here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But more than celebrating a robust community of market leaders, the AllSeen Alliance is excited to see the rapid adoption of the AllJoyn open source framework in commercial products. On the IFA show floor, companies including Monster, Lenco and Shaspa all showcased technologies enabled with AllJoyn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LG unveiled the LG Smart Home, the company’s AllJoyn-compatible vision of the connected household of tomorrow. AllJoyn keeps users informed of their LG smart appliances’ operational statuses – so, for example, as soon as the washer has completed a load, the user will automatically receive a ‘Washer is done’ notification on their LG smart TVs featuring webOS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://i58.tinypic.com/11ru7fn.jpg&quot; style=&quot;height:525px; margin:10px 100px; width:700px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haier unveiled its &quot;U+ Smart living&quot; with AllJoyn, winning two “IFA Product Technical Innovation” awards. Haier’s exhibit at the show was interactive and demonstrated how other brands like Panasonic AllPlay Speakers and LIFX lights could interop with one another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://i58.tinypic.com/2zq91s2.jpg&quot; style=&quot;height:396px; margin:10px 100px; width:700px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another recent piece of news from the Alliance is the establishment of an &lt;a href=&quot;https://allseenalliance.org/news/blogs/2014/08/allseen-alliance-adds-certification-and-compliance-program-0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AllSeen Certification and Compliance Program&lt;/a&gt; that includes self-certification so that products can begin participating in our open ecosystem right away. The new program defines a minimum level of standardization that allows a company to use a “Designed for AllSeen” badge in product packaging and marketing materials. Think of it as an interoperability guarantee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In coming months, we’ll add an easy-to-use testing app to the program so device makers and IoT developers can be confident they’re successfully implemented a common set of technical requirements for the AllSeen Alliance. Third-party testing will also ensure products discover, expose their capabilities and securely work with each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With so much excitement and momentum, it’s hard to believe the AllSeen Alliance was born only nine months ago. We hope you’ll join us as we realize the potential of connected devices!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This past weekend, we held our first &lt;a href=&quot;https://allseenalliance.org/event/allseen-alliance-mini-hackfest&quot;&gt;Mini-HackFest at Local Motors&lt;/a&gt;. It united 50 developers of the open source community to learn more about the AllSeen Alliance’s AllJoyn open source project, collaborate with one another on cool tech and, most importantly, have some fun! It was exciting to see both novice and advanced developers, including students from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Seton1212&quot;&gt;Seton Catholic High School’s 1212 Robotics Team&lt;/a&gt;, join us to work on some really creative projects using AllJoyn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the best things about open source communities like the AllSeen Alliance is that they provide a forum for collaboration and problem-solving regardless of skill set, company affiliation or industry. The Aug. 23 Mini-HackFest was a great example of how technology can move forward faster when people are brought together to share their knowledge, innovate and enable change. For the AllJoyn open source project to become the common language for the Internet of Everything and to create a world of true connectivity, we need to work together. We’re really excited to see this happening within the Alliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who weren’t able to make it, here’s a look at some of the highlights from this weekend:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; longdesc=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/127235861@N05/14868766708/&quot; src=&quot;http://i57.tinypic.com/2chxmyd.jpg&quot; style=&quot;height:300px; margin:10px 100px; width:400px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linking Node Red Twitter APIs, Octoblu’s Node Blue and AllJoyn-enabled LIFX light bulbs to produce a rainbow effect color show when typing #lightshow&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://i57.tinypic.com/n33fno.jpg&quot; style=&quot;height:225px; line-height:1.538em; margin-left:100px; margin-right:100px; width:400px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1212 Robotics Team showcased three robots using Arduino Yun boards with AllJoyn to compete in a game against one another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://i57.tinypic.com/azevso.jpg&quot; style=&quot;height:300px; margin-left:100px; margin-right:100px; width:400px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Locking a car door with a pebble and having an AllJoyn notification sent to the TV to provide the state of the car such as “unlocked the car” or “headlights on”.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://i62.tinypic.com/k0hls5.jpg&quot; style=&quot;height:300px; margin-left:100px; margin-right:100px; width:400px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using an AllJoyn-enabled LG TV to control the speed and the amount of characters that could be displayed in the Closed Caption of a TV episode.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sign of a successful HackFest is when people are having fun, and I’m confident there was no shortage of that at Saturday’s event. Big thanks to AllSeen members AT&amp;amp;T Digital Life, Local Motors, Octoblu and Qualcomm Connected Experiences, Inc. for making this event possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those interested in more AllJoyn and IoT innovation, &lt;a href=&quot;https://allseenalliance.org/event/att-hackathon-code-car-home&quot;&gt;join us&lt;/a&gt; at the AT&amp;amp;T Code for Car &amp;amp; Home Hackathon at Super Mobility Week September 6-7 in Las Vegas. Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;
