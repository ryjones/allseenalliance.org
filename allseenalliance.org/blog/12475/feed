    &lt;p&gt;As we have worked to build the Internet of Things and deliver its promise of a billion interoperable devices, we’ve learned that success depends on an open framework that gives every product a common language and we’ve learned that building a framework of this scale and impact takes a vibrant and growing community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the AllSeen Alliance, you can see this community at work and in full swing: in the ongoing commitment of companies ranging in size from tiny startups to global multinationals, in the incredible collaboration among developers; and in the investment of time and resources towards a common. From the the new and established &lt;a href=&quot;https://allseenalliance.org/about/working-groups&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;workgroups&lt;/a&gt; tackling the challenges of making IoT real to the ever-growing list of  &lt;a href=&quot;https://allseenalliance.org/showcase&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AllJoyn enabled products hitting the market&lt;/a&gt;, the power of the AllSeen community is palpable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As IoT technologies mature, we’re seeing some of the worlds leading consumer electronics companies deepen their investments in open source software and collaborative development to accelerate this work and the market opportunities. AllSeen Alliance founding member &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/panasonic-to-share-intellectual-property-to-spur-growth-of-internet-of-things-300053921.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Panasonic today is signaling&lt;/a&gt; a major advancement in its strategy to contribute to and support open source software and collaborative development through the organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking today with AllSeen Alliance TSC chair at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/embedded-linux-conference&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Embedded Linux Conference&lt;/a&gt; in San Jose, Calif., Panasonic is announcing it will open source its device-to-cloud through the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opendof.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;OpenDOF Project&lt;/a&gt;, in part to contribute new source code in collaboration with the open source community to the AllSeen Alliance’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.allseenalliance.org/gateway/gatewayagent&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gateway Working Group&lt;/a&gt;. This work is expected to extend the reach of cloud-based capabilities in AllJoyn through interworking bridges for Echonet devices, security services and proximal networks. This internetworking can help ensure that all devices can benefit from AllJoyn services and can help extend the Alliance’s reach into Asian and European markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To create a global ecosystem of billions of interoperable products, applications and services, groups must not only make their solutions open but also interoperable with others. The AllSeen Alliance, which includes more than 140 members, is committed to creating a simple and open framework that the industry can use within the Internet of Everything technology stack. As a founding member of the AllSeen Alliance and a long-time member of the Linux Foundation, Panasonic shares a deep investment in collaborative development and open source technologies and we applaud the companies moves to this end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;

 <title>As simple As That</title>

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’m not a lawyer, so as always, when dealing with IP Policies you should consult your legal counsel for advice in your circumstances and please note that as with any other standards organization or open source software project, the AllSeen Alliance cannot bind companies that are not using AllSeen Alliance code or participating in the Alliance&#039;s ecosystem to any IP Policy. What follows applies to AllSeen Alliance&#039;s members, contributors, distributors and users of the code. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that out of the way, I would like to update everyone on an exciting change to the IP Policy at the Alliance that is designed to scale to the next billion devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge of the Internet of Everything is that it needs to be just that - an Internet of everything, a global ecosystem of billions of interoperable products, applications and services all speaking the same language, all working together regardless of manufacturer, industry or platform. AllJoyn is the open source software project built by the AllSeen Alliance’s thriving technical community of over 110 companies that is delivering on this challenge, creating simple and open technology that connects everything and enables the Internet of Everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Device manufacturer and application developers are busy creating smart connected products with widely different use cases that will be combined in untold ways and sold across jurisdictions. They want the enabling power of AllJoyn but they need it delivered within an Intellectual Property (IP) framework that is clear, concise and aligned with the realities of global business.  The challenge to delivering this is that the software that results from the AllJoyn project is the work of many contributors, each participating in a different context, under different constraints, for companies with different corporate goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today we are pleased to announce a revised IP policy that strikes a careful balance, aligning the interests of all of the Alliance stakeholders. This IP framework is designed to enable contribution to AllJoyn under clear terms and to facilitate broad adoption of AllJoyn in products meeting the interoperability goals of the certification program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new IP policy makes it very clear: &lt;em&gt;Use a compliant base implementation of the AllJoyn code, certify your product, and you are good to go - it’s as simple as that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s because the contributors who have and will contribute code to the project are giving you an open source copyright license to the AllJoyn code and a pledge not to assert the patents they own that are required to implement their contribution in a certified AllJoyn implementation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AllSeen IP Policy &lt;a href=&quot;https://allseenalliance.org/about/governance/ip-policy&quot;&gt;https://allseenalliance.org/about/governance/ip-policy&lt;/a&gt;, as updated 22 January 2015, has a few simple components to its structure that are important to call out as they highlight the intent and goals:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Alliance will continue to use the permissive ISC License for copyrights.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Contributors now make a patent pledge not to assert any of their patents practiced in their contribution against an Alliance-certified implementation of AllJoyn (see “Compliant Base Implementation” in the policy).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The policy includes a patent pledge termination provision to create a self-policing community and to deter companies involved in developing and using AllSeen code from asserting patents against compliant base implementations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach borrows from other patent pledge models. You might ask “why didn’t the Alliance use X license instead?” The truth is aligning patent provisions to the goals of an effort as complex as AllSeen Alliance is difficult to do, and unfortunately there were no “off the shelf” options that would cover the concerns of developers, manufacturers, contributing companies and startups involved in the Alliance. The best approach proved to be starting with well understand patent pledge terms and aligning them to the goals of the Alliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting here has taken a bit of time. When we formed the AllSeen Alliance just over a year ago, we did not have a policy around patents because we knew that getting it right would take a lot of effort. Because our key goal is creating an interoperable ecosystem of billions of devices, our first step on the path entailed understanding what should be required to certify a product as compliant and therefore interoperable. With that in hand, we rolled out the first phase of the certification and compliance program, &lt;a href=&quot;https://allseenalliance.org/news/blogs/2014/08/allseen-alliance-adds-certification-and-compliance-program-0&quot;&gt;Designed for AllSeen&lt;/a&gt; in Aug 2014 and then moved on to tackling revisions to the IP policy that provided the clarity needed for manufacturers and developers. We think the wait was worth it. A lot of thoughtful work went into building our new IP policy and the supporting procedures around it that ensure its success. We now have a revised IP Policy that we hope will continue to expand our thriving technical ecosystem and deliver an open, interoperable Internet of Everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IP Policy: &lt;a href=&quot;https://allseenalliance.org/about/governance/ip-policy&quot;&gt;https://allseenalliance.org/about/governance/ip-policy&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IP Policy FAQ: &lt;a href=&quot;https://allseenalliance.org/about/governance/ip-policy-faq&quot;&gt;https://allseenalliance.org/about/governance/ip-policy-faq&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a very special week: The AllSeen Alliance is celebrating its &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://allseenalliance.org/announcement/commercial-adoption-major-investments-and-key-technical-contributions-put-allseen&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;one-year anniversary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and what a tremendous year it has been, far surpassing anything this community could have hoped for when it launched in December 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In just one year, the AllSeen Alliance has grown to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://allseenalliance.org/announcement/allseen-alliance-reaches-100-companies-committed-advance-internet-everything&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;more than 100 organizations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. The initiative has been powerful for everyone who has been a part of it. We’ve been able to work together as companies that are both competitors and collaborators to move a technology and an entire industry forward. That’s no small feat. An open source project shouldn’t invent what doesn’t need to be invented. The innovation lies where we can build upon a technology that we collaboratively created. That’s what AllJoyn provides for IoT. An open platform to enable innovation on top of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In just one year, through the power of a shared vision and a commitment to collaborate across industry lines, the AllSeen Alliance, the world’s largest collaborative open source project focused on the Internet of Things, has become the place to solve IoT’s biggest challenges -- interoperability and fragmentation. We have nine Working Groups that are producing code to address critical areas impacting IoT interoperability, including lighting, home automation, security, cloud and analytics. Those include QEO’s data-driven APIs and security enhancements contributed by Technicolor; new lighting service APIs and connected lighting framework from LIFX; a new gateway agent from Affinegy; software update services from Red Bend; analytics from Tellient; and a smart home gateway from Haier; among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In just one year, the AllSeen Alliance has augmented and advanced AllJoyn - a software framework powering commercial products today, simple and open technology that connects everything. AllJoyn is an open, universal and secure framework that enables companies to create interoperable products that can discover, connect and interact directly with any other AllJoyn-enabled products. The third release of AllJoyn will be available for download next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In just one year, there are dozens of AllJoyn-enabled products in the market, ensuring interoperability among devices in homes and businesses. We’re excited that this roster of products includes Gramofon by Fon, LG televisions, LIFX smart LED light bulbs, Local Motors Rally Fighter, Musaic Wireless HiFi System, Powertech APPSTRIGGER smart socket and Panasonic ALL Series Wireless Speakers, among others. Our &lt;strong&gt;“&lt;a href=&quot;https://allseenalliance.org/certification&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Designed for AllSeen&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/strong&gt; certification and compliance program was launched earlier this year to ensure consumers receive seamless, out-of-the-box interoperability with AllJoyn-enabled devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In just one year, the AllSeen Alliance members and contributors have accomplished so much, but there is still a lot more work to do because the opportunities for IoT are many. The power of the AllSeen Alliance grows from our members. The more voices we can bring to the table, the more we know. The more we know, the more we can get done, the better the results and the greater the innovation. The year ahead holds a lot of excitement and potential for AllJoyn and the future of connected things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the year to come, I look forward to seeing more AllJoyn-enabled products come to market and to the realization of an industry transformation born from massive collaboration. Cheers to an innovative 2015!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Philip DesAutels is senior director of IoT at the Linux Foundation and is responsible for managing The AllSeen Alliance collaborative project.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn more about how the AllSeen Alliance is paving the way for IoT interoperability in this &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_MbMiFI9rQ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;video from the community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;
