    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5607/15777372492_e4ca6e08b1_k.jpg&quot; style=&quot;float:left; height:267px; margin:10px; width:400px&quot; /&gt;We’re hosting our second annual AllSeen Alliance Summit this October 19-21 in Seattle, which means the event is just over a month away!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With keynotes, a plugfest and three, distinct speaking tracks, we’ve designed this year’s program to cater to every key stakeholder in IoT - whether you’re a business decision maker, operations manager, developer or a technical product manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s 5 reasons you need to attend:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://allseensummit2015.sched.org/overview/type/business+%2F+product+management?iframe=no&amp;amp;w=i%3A100%3B&amp;amp;sidebar=yes&amp;amp;bg=no#.VfB-9rRdV0h&quot;&gt;Monetizing IoT, Certification, Edge Computing Analytics: &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;These are just a few of the business challenges to consider as the growth rate of connected devices climbs: How can a common framework like AllJoyn create revenue opportunities? How are engineering resources freed up when open source software is leveraged? We’ll hear from service providers, product makers, retailers and others who can share their experience to-date, the obstacles they’re facing, and the innovative solutions they’re finding in an open ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.&lt;strong&gt; Security. Privacy. Data. Cloud.&lt;/strong&gt; Seems like four reasons in one, right? These aren’t just buzzwords in IoT. These are real issues impeding our ability to move IoT from a term to a major market shift for businesses, industries and consumers. If you’re interested in a technical discussion around cloud gateways or keen to learn how data is managed across AllJoyn devices, services or apps,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/allseen-alliance-summit/program/schedule&quot;&gt;join the discussion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Networking&lt;/strong&gt;: This is the only industry event where you’ll have access to companies representing every horizontal area of interest in IoT. With 600+ attendees, both members and non-members, from all over the world, you’ll have unlimited opportunities in this 3-day event. Want to talk to product manufacturers or software application developers? What about cloud and data experts? They’re all coming to this event. Learn more about &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/allseen-alliance-summit/program/about&quot;&gt;who’s coming&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and how you can collaborate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. &lt;strong&gt;Parents. Chefs. Gardners. Athletes&lt;/strong&gt;. What really matters to consumers when it comes to smart, connected ‘things’? IoT is truly about providing everyone with flexibility and choice, regardless of brand or manufacturer. We’re hosting &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://allseensummit2015.sched.org/type/technical?iframe=no#.VfBrj2RVhBc&quot;&gt;technical talks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to cover ‘how’ we can realize this potential as well as business tracks that explore ‘what’ we need to do to better reach consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/allseen-alliance-summit/extend-the-experience/alljoyn-plugfest&quot;&gt;AllJoyn PlugFest:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; See the power of the AllJoyn ecosystem brought to life in two days of hands-on interaction and test sessions. The AllSeen interoperability Plugfest allows you to test your AllJoyn-enabled products with other devices in our private and well-supported environment, with experts on hand to help with issues in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked why companies should join and collaborate at this year&#039;s event, Philip DesAutels, AllSeen Alliance senior director, said, “This year’s AllSeen Alliance Summit is going to provide a unique opportunity for any stakeholder in IoT to network and collaborate so that we can work together to overcome the industry’s toughest challenges. From business sessions that allow leaders to brainstorm and troubleshoot industry hot topics like security and big data to hands-on learning labs that explore AllJoyn and products built using the software, everyone has something to gain from attending this event.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/allseen-alliance-summit/attend/register&quot;&gt;Register now&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and follow &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/AllSeenSummit?src=hash&quot;&gt;#AllSeenSummit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for live updates! And for those who didn’t catch us at the 2014 AllSeen Alliance Summit, take a look at this &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVdmT5Yllp0&amp;amp;list=PL4IDeLjCA5CPnjWo8OET8X0gg4d9F_D-k&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to see get an idea of what you can expect this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://shop.electrolux.co.uk/file/wCNNQLH/1c726f6d-130b-48e0-bf6a-6010607c06e3.png&quot; style=&quot;float:left; height:58px; margin:5px; width:250px&quot; /&gt;Electrolux, a premium member of the AllSeen Alliance, is a global leader in home appliances, based on deep consumer insight and developed in close collaboration with professional users. Electrolux offers thoughtfully designed, innovative and sustainable solutions for households and businesses, with products such as refrigerators, dishwashers, washing machines, cookers, vacuum cleaners, air conditioners and small domestic appliances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did Electrolux join the AllSeen Alliance?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At Electrolux we develop connected appliances with a consumer-centric approach. This means we want to leverage the technology to address unmet consumer needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We believe the Internet of Things/Internet of Everything has to be seamless and convenient for consumers to use. It has to be built on open, standardized platforms that make it as easy for consumers to add appliances to their network as it will be for new manufacturers to develop connected products. We have therefore decided to join the AllSeen Alliance, to support the development of the Internet of Everything with an open, universal development framework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does Electrolux hope to achieve through its participation in the Alliance?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We expect that integrating the AllJoyn open source software framework will help us to bring more innovations to our appliances, making them more exciting for our consumers. We expect that we’ll be able to work with the various partners in the Alliance to develop new types of services and capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What contributions is Electrolux making to the project?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a &lt;a href=&quot;https://allseenalliance.org/about/members&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Premier Member of the Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, Electrolux will work to develop the uses of the AllJoyn software, integrated in our appliances and together with the services of other partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, our booth at IFA in Berlin, the world’s largest trade fair for consumer electronics and home appliances, will showcase our vision for what we think the connected home will look like in the future.  We will use the AllJoyn software in our products and show how they can work seamlessly together with other products offered by partners in the Alliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also support the Alliance through many of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://allseenalliance.org/about/working-groups&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Working Groups&lt;/a&gt; that we participate in, helping to drive the development of the Alliance as well as recruit new members to the Alliance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you describe the Internet of Everything? Can you help us understand how our homes might function 10 years from now because of AllJoyn and the Alliance?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Internet of Everything and smart homes will become truly interesting for consumers when we offer products and services that enhance the experience and end result of everyday tasks. For instance, we are working on solutions for assisted cooking which will leverage our expertise gained from working with professional users and world-renowned chefs to help people achieve great tasting food with minimum effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of AllJoyn and the Alliance, we see even more opportunities for our consumers to achieve great things! The interaction between the consumer and different types of products, in an open community like the Alliance means that not only we as partners can bring new innovation to them, but it also allows anyone with a great idea to develop and implement it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How will the work of the AllSeen Alliance impact the industry in the short term? In the long term?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the short term the work will allow many partners with complementary offerings to work together. In the long term, the benefit will be for the consumers who will learn to recognize the AllJoyn symbol for the innovation and ease of use that it brings them.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;

He has held various appointments at Hewlett-Packard and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, as well as at the University of Illinois. Yuping&#039;s expertise in software and internet industry includes information retrieval, data mining, parallel processing, network communication, web development, mobile applications, cloud services, and cluster management. He currently works with emerging IoT opportunities and machine-to-machine communications, leading a growing team of researchers and developers at ThroughTek to develop complete and comprehensive solutions for IoT industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did you join the AllSeen Alliance?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.throughtek.com&quot;&gt;ThroughTek&lt;/a&gt; wants to be able to contribute and create opportunities for the Internet of Things (IoT) market by working together across company lines and industries. The AllSeen Alliance addresses the challenges associated with IoT and is working to create unified standards for connected devices. ThroughTek hopes to contribute with our experiences in delivering multimedia solutions for instant file access and video streaming in real-time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does ThroughTek hope to achieve through its participation in the Alliance?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The AllSeen Alliance provides members with the opportunity to create an open source communications framework to allow products and services to be part of a larger ecosystem. ThroughTek aims to expand its vertical integration to develop strategic services that will improve interoperability and optimize services for products and applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What contributions is ThroughTek making to the project?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ThroughTek is working to integrate the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.throughtek.com/features.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kalay cloud platform’s&lt;/a&gt; multimedia module to the AllJoyn framework. This would enable the AllJoyn software framework to support video streaming, push notification services and connectivity over the internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multimedia Streaming Interface - to enable data transmission of multimedia between AllJoyn devices; and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kalay Cloud Platform – provides cloud services, ie. data analytics, cloud recording, video streaming, push notification service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Example use case scenarios include:&lt;br /&gt;- Someone arrives at the door and rings the door phone (doorbell with camera installed);&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Notification is pushed directly to the homeowner’s smart TV and/or smart phone; and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Once notification is accepted, live video feed will be delivered to the smart TV and/or smart phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you describe the Internet of Everything? Can you help us understand how our homes and business might function 10 years from now because of AllJoyn and the Alliance?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The adoption of IoT is increasing with the number of connected devices, which is estimated to outnumber the human population three to one by 2020. This will transform and define new means for the way humans and machines interact with each other. Long-term collaboration will not only make products more intelligent, but it will create a learning ecosystem with objects working together. Greater connectivity and ultimate functionality through ubiquitous networking of the Internet will create highly personalized and often predictive connected experiences in smart environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is open source software and collaborative development important for advancing the Internet of Everything?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Open source software and collaborative development is important because it focuses on building foundations for IoT, while also creating new market opportunities that allow companies to develop compelling products and/or services to drive enhancements for consumer experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IoT ecosystem is vast; interoperability and the ability to embrace other APIs, applications and partner services will ultimately help to deliver more compelling products and services. Open source software allows businesses to save time and money on development while reducing time to bring IoT products to the market. In the end, open source technology benefits everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How will the work of the AllSeen Alliance impact the industry?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AllSeen Alliance will contribute software and engineering resources to create an open software framework that enables hardware makers, service providers and software developers to create interoperable devices and services. As IoT gains broader adoption, businesses will shift from products to outcome-based services, competing on the ability to deliver measurable results with value-added applications. Ultimately, a unified standard that can be used across different devices, applications and platforms will help the IoT market innovate and develop products to be integrated seamlessly into our lives.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.howdens.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Howdens Joinery&quot; src=&quot;https://www.howdens.com/content/image/1751-4315-3.jpg&quot; style=&quot;float:left; height:166px; width:208px&quot; /&gt;Howdens Joinery&lt;/a&gt; is a leader in the UK market for kitchen and joinery products selling on a B2B basis an inspirational, affordable and available range of kitchens, appliances, and joinery products.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did Howdens join the AllSeen Alliance?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a company we are a leading innovator through service and services for our customers. We must think about the kind of world our customers will be living in in 2020, in 2025 and beyond. How might we anticipate this potential future? How might we play a contributory role in creating it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some time now Howdens has been alert to developments in the both the idea and practicality of the ‘smart home’. The convergence of interconnectivity and the aspirations that come with the potential for interconnected homes, interconnected communities and cities raise exciting possibilities and opportunities. We are exploring connected appliances and getting these into our marketplace as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Howdens looked around for who could best help us on our journey and it was very clear that the network being developed by the Allseen Alliance would massively enhance our need for knowledge, understanding, relationships and route maps for creating the ‘smart, interconnected world’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does Howdens hope to achieve through its participation in the Alliance?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of our hopes have been raised in the previous comments – enhanced knowledge, guidance and connections. Beyond this, we look forward to playing an active and participatory role, where our relationships with our customers alongside the speed at which we can introduce products and services into the market can similarly guide and inform the network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have the ability to bring our experience and relationship with users into the Alliance, adding a breadth of real world scenarios. The future is a more sophisticated proposition, and we want to be part of a community that delivers successful solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you describe the Internet of Everything?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s interesting to see how the conceptual language mirrors the exponential growth in thinking about the interconnected world and interconnected living. ‘The Internet of Things’ morphing into the ‘Internet of Everything’!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of things that seem relatively certain to us, if you excuse the oxymoron. Greater interconnectivity in the way we live our lives will fundamentally change how companies and organizations relate to the ‘customer’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The opportunities that individuals and groups will have to participate actively with our brands will continuously shift; the power and influence that exists in all relationships will continue to favor the customer, to the point where terms such as  ‘customer’ or ‘client’ don’t adequately express the nature of this relationship. It’s started already; just look at the power that a site like ‘Trip Advisor’ yields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, as products become smarter and interconnected, they cease to be ‘products’ as we previously knew them. The type and levels of service that are negotiated and offered in the interconnected world become the more salient factor. The paradigm will shift towards how we can fine tune an offer of ‘products + services’ that will enhance what the customer is seeking to achieve with these things. And how effectively we can play a role in ensure their experience of using our “products + services” is a positive and fulfilling one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customers have a hard fought budget to spend and we must ensure that what they have bought into isn&#039;t rendered obsolete a little way down the line. We believe that AllJoyn has an important role to play in this regard. Ultimately, we are seeking to participate in the things that empower our customers in leading better lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is open source software and collaborative development important for advancing the Internet of Everything?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the world grows ever more complex, no one group or organisation can deliver all the required answers and solutions. We have already alluded to the fact that in an interconnected world, the things (i.e. whatever they might be fridges, phones, lighting consoles) cease to be things in themselves and better defined by their relationship to one another. So, in a way this redefinition demands a new openness and spirit of collaboration. In practical terms, open source is required to ensure that the spirit of development at every level can move forwards unhindered by outdated protocols and requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How will the work of the AllSeen Alliance impact the industry in the short term? In the long term?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the short term, we will look to working with the Alliance to help us move forward in our work on connected appliances and smart living. In the long term, we hope to play a significant role in the Alliance by helping to create a connected world that enhances and empowers each and every one of us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;

With its dual-band and simulcast mesh technology for wireless communication, INSTEON has created an Internet of Things platform for lighting control, leak, door and motion sensing, garage door control and other applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did you join the AllSeen Alliance?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November 2014, Insteon joined the AllSeen Alliance to utilize its collaborative and transparent forum to help develop the future of the Internet of Things. The AllSeen Alliance provides an open, universal language that supports the booming home automation industry and Insteon’s ultimate goal is to make life simple by bringing all connected devices into elegant command, so it’s a perfect alignment of efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does your company hope to achieve through its participation in the Alliance?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Above all, Insteon wants home automation to be simple. Our incorporation into the Allseen Alliance furthers that goal. Insteon joined the AllSeen Alliance to continue to expand its 200+ offerings and provide seamless integration with new devices for current and future Insteon customers. With the countless connected devices coming to market, Insteon is working with the AllSeen Alliance to provide simple and reliable technology that can be leveraged by others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What contributions is your company making to the project?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insteon has made a number of contributions to the Alliance, including the recent announcement of its open API that can be accessed by developers who want to build upon Insteon’s technology. The idea is to open the door to creativity and further exciting developments in the connected home arena.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Insteon continues to work with the Alliance on various AllJoyn-enabled product developments. Most recently, Insteon announced the release of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.insteon.com/insteon-hub-alljoyn&quot;&gt;AllJoyn-enabled Insteon Hub&lt;/a&gt;. The AllJoyn-enabled Insteon Hub makes it easy for developers to integrate their own applications with the Windows 10 AllJoyn SDK and communicate with the entire Insteon product line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you describe the Internet of Everything?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Insteon’s point of view, the Internet of Everything is a highly connected lifestyle, where individuals can seamlessly control and customize their devices from anywhere in the world. When you leave for the day, your devices should notice your location change and turn off all of the lights, turn off the TV, shut down the A/C, close the garage door, lock the doors and many other actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insteon and the members of the AllSeen Alliance have been continuously developing and building out solutions to fit various areas of need and opportunity in the home automation sector. As a result of this progress, we believe that a majority of homes will include home automation solutions by the next decade. We believe the connected lifestyle is here, and we’ll be seeing many more innovations come to life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is open source software and collaborative development important for advancing the Internet of Everything?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As smart homes are rapidly becoming the standard, it is crucial to develop a universal language where all devices can communicate in a simple, reliable way. Insteon knows that the connected home needs an interoperable ecosystem in which a wide range of devices and systems can easily connect and seamlessly share information in a simple, transparent way. The AllSeen Alliance is providing a collaborative forum for development and innovation that furthers these efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How will the work of the AllSeen Alliance impact the industry in the short term? In the long term?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an open source consortium, we believe the AllSeen Alliance is driving the widespread adoption of the Internet of Things and is supporting the development of a universal platform. The Alliance helps fuel innovation by providing a place where companies can network, come together to solve programs and find new integrated solutions for tomorrow’s connected home.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;

Since 2007, our organizational DNA has been in serving the world’s largest carriers with connectivity, scale, stability and performance. By extending our platform and global business expertise to device manufactures and startups, we help today’s disruptive technologies become tomorrow’s household names. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did you join the AllSeen Alliance?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kii is providing cloud backend for mobile applications and IoT device solutions (BaaS).   Our offering includes device management, device analytics, user management, data management, push notification, geo location, end user behavior analytics, A/B Testing etc.  Kii&#039;s main customers are device manufactures, mobile application developers, service providers such as carrier, cable TV companies and Internet service providers.   We believe the AllSeen Alliance’s approach is good and something we feel strongly about being a part of. Because we have a partnership with potential IoT solution distribution channels, we believe that we can help ensure distribution of AllSeen-enabled devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does your company hope to achieve through its participation in the Alliance?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through our participation within the Alliance, we hope to create compelling solutions for end users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What contributions is your company making, or is considering making, to the project?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since we have expertise in a cloud, a capability of focus for AllJoyn, we would like to help develop a business model(s) using cloud service for AllJoyn-enabled devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you describe the Internet of Everything? Can you help us understand how our homes and business might function 10 years from now because of AllJoyn and the Alliance?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve been talking about the Internet of Everything (IoE) for almost 10 years now, but it’s only recently that we’ve seen a huge boom in the space. The AllSeen Alliance allows more people to jump in to create very interesting solutions and applications. By having open protocol and APIs on IoE devices, AllJoyn will create a open and interoperable ecosystem like to what we’ve seen in proprietary ecosystems like Apple and Google’s smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is open source software and collaborative development important for advancing the Internet of Everything?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My previous experience as a board member of the Infrared Data Association (IrDA) helped me understand how difficult it is to ensure interoperability. I understand the value of creating a specification on top of an open source framework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How will the work of the AllSeen Alliance impact the industry in the short term? In the long term?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is strong momentum behind the AllSeen Alliance, especially in the growth and scope of its member companies. Members include companies that provide all of the necessary IoE components. The Alliance will continue to grow and will quickly expand to cover many user cases. The growth of the Alliance will benefit end users by  providing solutions that are easier to use, interoperable and cost effective.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, we believe that the Alliance’s open source developers will grow into a huge community and unbelievable innovation will happen within it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;AllJoyn 15.04 is &lt;a href=&quot;https://allseenalliance.org/developers/download&quot;&gt;available for download&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fourth major release of AllJoyn since the Alliance was formed, 15.04 builds on the rich, commercially deployed AllJoyn foundation to deliver higher performance, extended scalability and enhanced security features. These enhancements strengthen AllJoyn’s capabilities in consumer, enterprise and industrial scenarios. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Features for AllJoyn 15.04 &lt;a href=&quot;https://git.allseenalliance.org/cgit/core/alljoyn.git/plain/alljoyn_core/docs/ReleaseNotes.txt?h=RB15.04&quot;&gt;Standard Library&lt;/a&gt; include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Property cache feature which adds a simple, optional cache to ProxyBusObject that keeps track of property values as received in GetProperty, GetAllProperties calls and PropertiesChanged signals;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;​Support for X.509 ECDSA digital certificates, which replace the X.509 RSA certificates;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Remove excessive name transfer for all sessions. This limits the names exchanged to just the routing node and host/joiners as a part of an effort to reduce network traffic;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Observer Functionality: this feature simplifies interface based discovery of bus objects by filtering such that listeners only trigger if something relevant has changed in an About Announcement. It also enables automatic session setup and takes care of proxy bus object creation and life-cycle management;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is now possible to build for Android without requiring OpenSSL from the platform, this greatly simplifies making Android builds;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add to About C API: a second announce_using_datalistener method was added that takes as argument an AboutDataListener instead of AboutData;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add support for detecting idle RNs allowing the RN to shut down automatically if no LNs have used its services for a while; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Support for iOS 8.1.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Features for AllJoyn 15.04 &lt;a href=&quot;https://git.allseenalliance.org/cgit/core/ajtcl.git/tree/ReleaseNotes.txt?h=RB15.04&quot;&gt;Thin Library&lt;/a&gt; include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Allow the setting of the UNMARSHAL_TIMEOUT. This gives applications explicit control over how long unmarshalling waits for new input before giving up;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;AJTCL Router Selection (ASACORE-803). TC applications now use the rank advertised by the router to select the most desirable router;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Support for X.509 ECDSA digital certificates, which replace the X.509 RSA certificates;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;AJTCL adds information string to reply messages. This feature duplicates the standard library API functionality that allows information to be added to a reply message;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add support for specifying NVRAM file location on Windows; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;EXPERIMENTAL: UDP Transport for TC &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; RN connections. Thin Client to Routing Node version of a UDP-based transport.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This release of AllJoyn is validated to run on the following platforms:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Linux Ubuntu&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Android JellyBean&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Windows 7, 8.1 and 10&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;iOS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;OSX&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;OpenWRT&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AllSeen Alliance has surpassed 160 member organizations invested in the AllJoyn open source software project. Diversity in members collaborating across industries creates richer, more stable and highly scalable code. We encourage you to join us and further advance AllJoyn as the simple and open technology for the Internet of Everything. &lt;a href=&quot;https://allseenalliance.org/developers/download&quot;&gt;Download the code&lt;/a&gt;, join the conversation and get started today!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Weaved logo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.safelogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Weaved_LogoResize.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border-style:solid; border-width:0px; float:left; height:166px; margin:2px; width:250px&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.weaved.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Weaved &lt;/a&gt;is start-up based in downtown Palo Alto, founded by serial entrepreneurs with a deep background in TCP/IP networking and cloud services.  The Company is angel funded and backed by some of the top investors for both networking and cloud service companies.  Weaved is committed to the vision of making it possible for anyone to create their own Internet of Things applications, to realize the Internet of Things for Everyone.  Today, the Company offers a fully capable, software-only, hardware-agnostic platform along with drop-in services, to easily enable sophisticated users and developers to add Internet of Things capability to any already networked products.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did Weaved join the AllSeen Alliance?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As long time participants in the Internet connected market, we realized the need for a baseline interoperability standard. The Alliance’s vision of providing an open source framework, combined with the quality and number of initial members, prompted us to join as a founding member.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does Weaved hope to achieve through its participation in the Alliance?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We hope to become a participant in the formation and establishment of the Internet of Things ecosystem. Through participation in the Alliance, we believe we will be exposed to a wide range of different industries and like-minded providers, with who we can collaborate and partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What contributions is Weaved making to the project?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To date our participation has been in thought leadership and marketing. Going forward, we expect to be active in both the marketing and technical aspects of the project as it relates to end-user usability, especially where legacy interfaces can leverage the Alliance&#039;s work to add new &quot;connected&quot; features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you describe the Internet of Everything? Can you help us understand how our homes and business might function 10 years from now because of AllJoyn and the Alliance?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We believe that 10 years from now, no businesses or product economies will exist that don&#039;t leverage the Internet of Everything. Initially this will involve connectivity and control mostly via mobile devices, evolving to machine learning and big data analysis for user experience benefits, and ultimately, to transformation and optimization of industries as a result of the cumulative effect of the collected information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is open source software and collaborative development important for advancing the Internet of Everything?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technology and demand have outpaced development cycles during the Internet age. Much like the Internet infrastructure, open source will be the only means to allow for the rapid deployment of &#039;best practices&#039; and interoperable standards. Without an open source solution, the industry will be doomed to siloed point solutions – characterized by consumers who are resistant to adopt at a mass market level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How will the work of the AllSeen Alliance impact the industry in the short term? What about in the long term? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Near term the Alliance can impact existing network-enabled point solutions, by easily allowing them to become Internet-connected and industry interoperable. Over time, much like Internet protocol standards, the work that the Alliance is doing will provide the assurance of a baseline set of capabilities, ensuring multi vendor compatibility and capability.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://allseenalliance.org/sites/default/files/member_logos/member_comm_affinegy.jpg&quot; style=&quot;float:left; height:140px; margin:5px; width:200px&quot; /&gt;Since 2003, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.affinegy.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Affinegy&lt;/a&gt; has delivered connected device management solutions to leading cable/telco broadband service providers and device manufacturers that help consumers customers with installation, provisioning, management and support of services.  Now, Affinegy’s software enables full, easy, secure device connectivity in the Internet of Things.  Affinegy is a leader in the AllSeen Alliance, the broadest cross-industry consortium to advance the Internet of Things.  Affinegy is headquartered in Austin, TX with additional offices in Dallas, and Wroclaw, Poland.  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did you join the AllSeen Alliance?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a 2003 era pioneer in a software platform that transformed unruly WiFi connection problems into a profitable managed service opportunity, we at Affinegy leaped early and became a founding and active member of the AllSeen Alliance. We viewed AllJoyn as the ideal protocol and a key component of the digital glue that makes the Internet of Things “just work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does your company hope to achieve through its participation in the Alliance?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through the Alliance, Affinegy aims to multiply the number of partners, customers, and suppliers we have that are united in desire and action to work to create interoperable products and services that are at the root of this Internet of Things market inflection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What contributions is your company making, or is considering making, to the project?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Affinegy is playing several active roles in the Alliance. Art Lancaster, Affinegy’s CTO, is entering his second year of service as a Community Director of the AllSeen Alliance Board. He also chairs the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.allseenalliance.org/gateway/gatewayagent&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gateway Working Group&lt;/a&gt; and is a Member of the Technical Steering Committee. Josh Spain, Director of Engineering at Affinegy, serves on the Technical Interface Review Board. Melissa Simpler serves on the Marketing Committee and is heavily engaged in the Tradeshow/Events Marketing Working Group. Affinegy is also contributing code via the Gateway Working Group and providing quality assurance resources to ensure the code of this working group is high quality and built for performance, security, and scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you describe the Internet of Everything? Can you help us understand how our homes and business might function 10 years from now because of AllJoyn and the Alliance?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Internet of Everything is the biggest market and technology inflection the world has seen since the Internet. Gartner, in their November 2013 Forecast report on IoT, reports that the number of connected things (excluding computers, tablets, and mobile phones) will grow 30-fold from 0.9 billion units in 2009 to 26 billion units by 2020. Further, that the total cost of a basic microcontroller, Bluetooth connectivity and a simple sensor (temperature, vibration or acceleration), will approach $1 by 2020. Cost will no longer be a barrier to commercialization. Look no further than Amazon’s latest IoT product announcement, AmazonDash, to see evidence. Brands, large and small, will all connect anything and everything to the Internet, their users and their products – those that cost just a few dollars to those that cost many thousand dollars. These connections will fuel “always connected” social behavior and demand for Cloud and interconnected Cloud services. New information exchange and data mining/analytics markets will be birthed to make life or work activities more predictive, automated, and convenient. Hopefully the automation will free us as humans to be more productive and creative in higher orders of thinking and doing, and hopefully we will not trend toward the world imagined in the Sci-Fi movie, Wall-e.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AllSeen Alliance is at the heart of these changes. The Alliance drives widespread adoption of the Internet of Everything through its leading and key interoperable peer connectivity and communications framework based on AllJoyn that hundreds of member companies are contributing to and planning to incorporate into their products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is open source software and collaborative development important for advancing the Internet of Everything?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ubiquity of the Internet grew largely through open source and open standards like Netscape, HTML, Apache and Linux.  We believe this same success of open source is foundation of achieving broad interoperability in the Internet of Things. The truly open and “code first” core of the Alliance achieves speed to market and best of breed products in market. All the work of the AllSeen Alliance is fully open and available to everyone – no requirement to join until you want to contribute to the project’s technical direction. .  Critical learning from early deployments brings user feedback back into the design and development process very rapidly to drive responsive improvements. The collaborative working group structure of the Alliance brings together members from within the Alliance to work on common objectives. The diversity of the members ensures that the protocol comprehensively serves multiple and wide-ranging market needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How will the work of the AllSeen Alliance impact the industry in the short term? In the long term?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AllSeen Alliance is the leading contender to bring global Internet of Everything interoperability, robust security and compatibility across the broadest number and range of brands’ services and things. &lt;a href=&quot;https://allseenalliance.org/showcase&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Products are already in market today&lt;/a&gt;, including LG Smart TVs, LIFX light bulbs, Musaic  HiFi sound, Fon’s Gramofon, and more. The membership base has grown from a base of 20 to over 150 companies in just 16 months with that growth trend continuing and even increasing.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://organicresponse.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Organic Response logo&quot; src=&quot;https://allseenalliance.org/sites/default/files/member_logos/logo_organic.png&quot; style=&quot;float:left; height:140px; margin:3px; width:200px&quot; /&gt;Organic Response&lt;/a&gt; is a sensor-based lighting control system that uses distributed intelligence to maximize energy savings and occupancy comfort. By utilizing distributed intelligence, it has delivered a plug and play system that requires no wiring or commissioning to deliver simple but sophisticated lighting control. A key aspect of the technology is the smart sensor network, called the Occupancy Information Cloud, that is created when Organic Response enabled lighting is installed. This enables each light fixture to be continuously aware of what is happening within the broader network, and as such is ideally suited to a fast and exciting transition into the Internet of Everything.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did you join the AllSeen Alliance?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were a number of reasons for this. Firstly we wanted to tap in to the community in general and gain an insight to what people are doing in the space. We were obviously keen to contribute to and shape the development of the software to suit our idea of where we thought IoT should go, and of course utilise the open source code that is being generated.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does your company hope to achieve through its participation in the Alliance?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We hope to dramatically speed up the development of IoT and our participation in this exciting new technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What contributions is your company making, or is considering making, to the project?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We bring our unique method of collecting occupancy and other sensor information within buildings for the ultimate goal of resource efficiency - whether the resource is energy, or real estate. By sharing this rich information with other devices, systems and people we allow all of them to operate as smartly as our lighting control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you describe the Internet of Everything? Can you help us understand how our homes and business might function 10 years from now because of AllJoyn and the Alliance?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Internet of Everything is really about collecting and sharing information to make smarter decisions, and operate more efficiently. Whether it is machine to machine, or to people if we have the right data at the right time we can transform the way energy is consumed and resources are utilised. If we get this right everything and everyone will become so much smarter. Alljoyn has a crucial role to play to ensure we get it right, and get it right at the right time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;
