    &lt;p&gt;On September 6 and 7, the AllSeen Alliance participated in the AT&amp;amp;T Hackathon, Code for Car &amp;amp; Home, before CTIA’s “Super Mobility Week” show in Las Vegas. This event brought together the best companies, tools and services for developers to innovate in the connected car and automated home marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the featured technologies that developers could innovate on was AllJoyn®, the collaborative open source project of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.allseenalliance.org/&quot;&gt;AllSeen Alliance&lt;/a&gt; that provides a software framework and set of services to enable interoperability for the Internet of Everything (IoE).  IoE is one of the hottest topics today, and it’s important to remember that this new connected space cannot be just an “Internet of One Thing.”  Each connected product needs to talk to other products and interoperate. “Everything” needs to work together for the best consumer experience and for developers to be creative to build connected applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AllJoyn software framework is an important key to solving the interoperability problem for IoE and also allows devices and applications to talk with each other without a network -- peer to peer.  The software allows for a publication of APIs across the network that can be discovered and interacted with.  These APIs can be implementations driven by the AllSeen Alliance or proprietary implementations by manufacturers and developers.  Developers have access to the AllJoyn open source code itself to use, modify, or learn. AllJoyn is software that can be used to create amazing interconnected applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AllSeen Alliance brings together a large set of companies from different product verticals that encompasses a disparate range of objects and devices in homes and businesses.  Again, IoE must allow for everything to communicate together for it to be successful and for developers to take advantage of the new experiences that they can help create.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current AllJoyn version 14.06 can be downloaded as a precompiled SDK for mobile platforms or as source code to compile on a Linux, Windows or other desktop platforms.  The AllJoyn framework contains the Standard Core Library (SCL) for High Level OSes (HLOS) and the Thin Core Library (TCL) that is designed to run on Micro Controller Units (MCU).  Memory constrained devices, thanks to AllJoyn, have the ability to interact with other products to do new powerful things. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m excited about some of the new features that were just added with the AllJoyn v14.06 release.  First there is a new discovery and advertising mechanism that is called the “Next Generation Name Service” (NGNS) and support for “Events and Actions” (E&amp;amp;A).  These new AllJoyn core features are improvements to help developers enhance the applications that they create.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NGNS is a net zero change for developers who have already written an AllJoyn application.  You just update the AllJoyn Core SDK to the new version and this new discovery and advertising feature occurs under the hood in the AllJoyn Core software.  NGNS migrates AllJoyn to using unicast mDNS vs the legacy WHO-HAS and IS-AT UDP packets that is mDNS-like.  The nature of improving the advertising &amp;amp; discovery ensures a more reliable means of being able to detect if an application/device is present in the network and is still present and has not walked away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AllJoyn Core v14.06 SDK also includes a new Ping method in the BusAttachment class.  This method allows for a very fine level for detecting application/device presence.  Prior to this method it would take up to 120 seconds (60 seconds on average) to determine if an application/device wandered away.  Using the Ping method, you as a developer, get to decide how often you wish to check if an application is still around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the other power features added in the Core v14.06 SDK is Events and Actions.  This gives a developer the control to describe an API call in human readable text.  It allows a person to understand what the BusMethod or Signal’s role is in the application/device.  An &quot;Event&quot; is a human readable description to an AllJoyn Signal. An &quot;Action&quot; is a human readable description to a BusMethod.  To support this, the core software now includes a new interface “org.allseen.Introspectable” which has a BusMethod of IntrospectionWithDescription which will return the requested Object’s Introspection XML + descriptions so that they can be rendered in a developer’s application. The net result is that a person using an application can now understand what a device sends out and what other devices accept so that they can create sentences with the descriptions (a rule as some say).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, a front door may emit a signal of o(). This is meaningless to a person because they have no idea that &quot;o()&quot; actual means “door open”. But the developer can use the AllJoyn Core v14.06 SDK  (SCL or TCL) and add a description to this event—for example &quot;The door has opened&quot;. Now a person knows that their fancy door sends out something when it opens. The Consumer then goes and buys a light bulb that exposes a BusMethod (action) with the description: &quot;The light blinks red&quot;. Because events are signals and actions are methods, we can have an in-between application that links these together so that a sentence forms: &quot;The door has opened, The light blinks red.&quot; This is completely dynamic and utilizes the AllJoyn software framework to accomplish interoperability among products and applications no matter who made them.  The door and light manufacturers don&#039;t need to get together to work on making these interactions possible.  People can connect their products in ways that they can easily understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are just two of the new features and a taste of all the features included in the AllJoyn software framework.  For more details about AllJoyn, view the &lt;a href=&quot;https://attdeveloper.webex.com/attdeveloper/onstage/g.php?t=a&amp;amp;d=661329075&quot;&gt;AllJoyn tutorial&lt;/a&gt; that was held for AT&amp;amp;T’s Code for Car and Home Bootstrap or watch the AllSeen Alliance’s recorded training sessions on AllJoyn.  For any questions, please point your browser to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ask.allseenalliance.org&quot;&gt;ask.allseenallinace&lt;/a&gt;.  Members of the AllSeen Alliance familiar with AllJoyn will be able to help you with issues or questions that come up in your development efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brian Spencer is Staff, Engineer/Manager at Qualcomm Connected Experiences, Inc. (QCE).  He works as a Customer Engineer focused on supporting Internet of Everything solutions at QCE .  Spencer has helped many developers create IoE devices and applications powered by AllJoyn® software framework and some consider him the foremost expert in AllJoyn applications.  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;
