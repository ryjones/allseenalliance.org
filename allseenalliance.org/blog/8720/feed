    &lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, we hosted the first &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/allseen-alliance-summit/program/about&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.538em;&quot;&gt;AllSeen Alliance Summit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, an event designed to provide a collaborative and educational space for the innovators, developers and users of the Internet of Things (IoT) and AllSeen Alliance ecosystem. We’re still buzzing from the excitement and energy at the event, which united nearly 230 attendees from 100 companies across 19 countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the holidays upon us and the first year of the Alliance almost complete, we’re feeling humbled by and thankful for the tremendous support and true collaborative nature of this initiative. The AllSeen Alliance Summit was proof that the Alliance is much more than the names of its current &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://allseenalliance.org/about/members&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.538em;&quot;&gt;80 member companies and 12 supporting organizations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies big and small met over this two-day Summit to talk about what the Alliance needs to make good on its promise to “enable the widespread adoption and accelerate the development and evolution of an interoperable peer connectivity and communications framework based on AllJoyn for devices and applications in the Internet of Everything.” That’s a mouthful, right? But what it really means is quite simple: members will work together using open source best practices on a common code base. The code will provide the features and functions needed for devices and applications to exchange data and control information. Fragmentation will be avoided and interoperability maximized because all members will be deploying the same code to implement the same functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s this shared vision that was ever so apparent at the event. From keynotes to working group breakout sessions, attendees took a deep dive into the areas of critical importance for the Internet of Everything. Topics included:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Evolving security for IoT;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Analytics for IoT;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Makers and Crowdsourcing: The power of collaboration;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A Community for IoT: A look back at the AllSeen Alliance’s first year; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Advancing AllJoyn beyond the home.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work of one is not nearly as effective as the work of many, pooled together, and that’s what we’re doing. We’re breaking down the silos, putting aside competitive interests and working collaboratively to move an entire market forward. This is the power of open source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have code, ideas or a willingness to participate in any way, join us! More than the common vision and path forward we share, it’s the spirit that has made this community so much more than we could have imagined it to become. Take a look at the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/allseen-alliance-summit&quot; style=&quot;line-height: 1.538em;&quot;&gt;photos and keynote videos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; from the event and stay tuned for an upcoming AllSeen event. We looking forward to our future together!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve been in the software field for more than 30 years, and I must say I’ve seen few things more exciting than what’s happening just six months since the AllSeen Alliance was created. We now have 50 members hard at work expanding the &lt;a href=&quot;https://allseenalliance.org/developer-resources/alljoyn-open-source-project&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AllJoyn&lt;/a&gt; open source Internet of Everything framework or building it into their products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most gratifying is seeing the community respond to the call for true Internet of Things (IoT) interoperability by &lt;em&gt;voting with their code&lt;/em&gt;. Members are devoting time, effort and creative energy to grow the framework and advance the widespread use of AllJoyn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, we hit another milestone as the Alliance announces the release of AllJoyn, &lt;a href=&quot;https://allseenalliance.org/source-code&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Version 14.06&lt;/a&gt;, to further enable the ability to connect devices and systems across brands, transports, platforms and operating systems. This is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://allseenalliance.org/news/blogs/2014/03/open-source-framework-internet-everything-gets-update&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;second release &lt;/a&gt;since the Alliance’s formation in December. We’re on a fast-paced schedule that reflects the strong, collaborative interest within the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Version 14.06 is largely about improving overall security and performance of the AllJoyn framework as we scale to large networks of IoT devices ranging from embedded system microcontrollers running an RTOS to SmartTVs, home appliances, mobiles, tablets, PC’s and server class devices running high-level operating systems. The project now includes enhanced security algorithms using elliptic curve cryptography, new features simplifying M2M interactions, fast discovery with reliability, low power use and optimizations for publish/subscribe use cases such as sensors. This release also brings improved support for iOS developers. The result is significant performance improvements to overall network performance and the basis for the next stage in the evolution of the platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re wondering how developers can get involved, that’s easy: AllJoyn is an open source software framework project. Developers don’t have to be members of the AllSeen Alliance to make contributions. Open development means that anyone can get involved and contribute to the evolution of the codebase. The Alliance provides detailed information on&lt;a href=&quot;https://allseenalliance.org/developer-resources/how-to-participate&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; how to make contributions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned as well for the scheduling of more AllSeen Alliance&lt;a href=&quot;https://allseenalliance.org/news/blogs/2014/04/we-re-throwing-hackfest-and-everyone-invited&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; HackFests&lt;/a&gt; – intensive days of training labs, hands-on coding and fun. The first AllSeen HackFest took place May 1 in San Jose and went really well. More than 80 attendees received an introduction to AllJoyn and hands-on training for software and hardware integration with the project. As for making code contributions to AllJoyn, you don’t need to be an AllSeen Alliance member or have any previous connection to the group to participate.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Internet of Everything is about making smart connected devices and objects work together. The motivation for the AllSeen Alliance and the reason for the AllJoyn framework is to enable developers from multiple industries, using various programming languages, tools chains, operating environments and hardware platforms to create applications designed for interoperability. But to make this a reality we need to provide developers with the information and tools they need to get started developing IoE applications.  This is the goal of the first &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.allseenalliance.org/develop/hackfests/1may2014hackfest#registration&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AllSeen Alliance HackFest&lt;/a&gt;, to be held May 1 in San Jose; an intensive day of training labs and hands-on coding, and a lot of fun!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Internet of Everything continues to gain steam as one of technology’s hottest topics and market opportunities; Gartner recently predicted the IoE will encompass 26 billion devices by 2020, up from 900 million five years ago; so needless to say we are expecting a lot of interest in the HackFest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This HackFest is the first public event since the AllSeen Alliance formed in December last year. It will be co-located with the Linux Foundation&#039;s Embedded Linux Conference at the San Jose Marriott, is free to attend and open to anyone. You do not need to be an AllSeen Alliance member or have any previous connection to the group, just bring your notebook computer, coding skills and desire to work in small teams on a cool IoE project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the HackFest you will learn more about how the AllJoyn framework enables devices to discover each other, connect and interact and how to develop interoperable applications. It is also an opportunity to talk to others in the technical community and swap ideas, give your opinion, and, of course, write code. There’s even a free lunch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HackFests are a key component of the AllSeen Alliance&#039;s mission to grow the code, expand the community and enable the widespread use of the AllJoyn framework. As with all open, collaborative initiatives, it is literally in developers’ hands to move the project forward. So we’re really excited about the event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are only a limited number of seats available, so if you’re interested in attending, reserve your seat today. To view the full agenda or register, visit the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.allseenalliance.org/develop/hackfests/1may2014hackfest#registration&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;HackFest Wiki&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We hope to see you on May 1!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;field-body view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once in a while, I bump into someone still uncertain about the difference between “AllSeen” and “AllJoyn.” So let me start with a quick refresher: The AllSeen Alliance is the consortium of companies, 35 as of today, that are collaborating on an open source software framework that allows devices and systems to autonomously discover and interact with nearby products regardless of brand, transport layer, platform or operating system. AllJoyn is the framework codebase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, the Alliance is announcing the first new release of AllJoyn since the Alliance’s creation. &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.allseenalliance.org/release/overview&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Version 14.02&lt;/a&gt; contains performance and stability improvements and bug fixes, among other improvements to advance this universal, collaborative framework for the Internet of Everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Version 14.02’s release originally was going to be in April, but we moved it up to align with a four-month release cadence. So you can expect additional releases in June and October. If you’re wondering about the version number 14.02, the next one with be 14.06, the one after 14.10. Get it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In parallel to developing the new release, we have been running a &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.allseenalliance.org/training&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;series of training sessions&lt;/a&gt; to help bring the community up to speed on the AllJoyn framework and base-services. These presentations have been recorded and are available for download on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.allseenalliance.org/training&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AllSeen Wiki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With 14.02 released earlier than expected, we now have more time for feature development on 14.06. The exact feature sets for core and base services are still being nailed down but will be presented by the Alliance working group chairs to the technical steering committee for approval within the next several weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of &lt;a href=&quot;https://allseenalliance.org/about-allseen/governance/project-and-working-group-lifecycle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;working groups&lt;/a&gt;, we currently have three -- core, base services and development tools, essentially grandfathered in from alljoyn.org. We have a proposal for a working group on Certification &amp;amp; Compliance (C&amp;amp;C). Since interoperability in the Internet of Things is the driving force behind the AllSeen Alliance, getting the C&amp;amp;C working group up and running to develop test cases, frameworks and test code is an especially high priority for the Alliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have an idea for a working group or a project within one of the existing working groups and are willing either individually or as a corporation to commit the development resources to make it happen, there is a simple process for getting a proposal in front of the Alliance’s Technical Services Committee. &lt;a href=&quot;https://allseenalliance.org/about-allseen/governance/project-and-working-group-lifecycle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Learn more about submitting a proposal.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Greg Burns is the AllSeen Alliance TSC Chair&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Greg Burns is the AllSeen Alliance TSC Chair&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems self-evident. To achieve the promise of the Internet of Everything – a state of ubiquitous communication among a variety of everyday objects and devices – you need all these things to be on the same page in terms of compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that is not the case today. Individual vendors have pursued the vision, but none has gained widespread traction. That’s because the very nature of the Internet of Everything requires a cross-industry, cross-platform and interoperable solution that discovers and connects devices, appliances, systems and services regardless of brand; and most importantly standardizes the language and terminology that devices use to communicate with each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter the AllSeen Alliance, &lt;a href=&quot;/announcement/technology-leaders-establish-allseen-alliance-advance-internet-everything&quot;&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt;, the broadest cross-industry consortium to date to work on this problem. The AllSeen Alliance’s mission is to foster the Internet of Everything through a common, open code base that enables interoperability and security among a wide range of devices – consumer electronics, appliances and even something as small as a light switch as well as a host of enterprise and industrial use cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That code base is an open framework based on the AllJoyn® open source project, which was originally developed by and is being contributed to the Alliance by Qualcomm Innovation Center, Inc., Qualcomm’s open source subsidiary. It consists of a code base that addresses such fundamental requirements as discovery, pairing, message routing and security, ensuring interoperability among even the most basic devices and systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial set of capabilities include: service discovery (learning about the features, functions of other nearby devices); onboarding to add a device to the user’s network; user notifications; a common control panel for creating rich user experiences; and audio streaming for simultaneous playback on multiple speakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the AllSeen Alliance will produce developer tools and verify correct implementation through a compliance program. Workgroups at launch include: Multimedia, Compliance, Basic Services, Core and Developer Tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re starting with 23 members from consumer electronics to networking to retail and the enterprise but we expect more companies and individuals to join the Alliance and/or contribute to and adopt the framework for their own products in the months ahead. Open development means that anyone looking to build an open solution can get involved and contribute to the evolution of the code base. Now, the many industry leaders who have come together in the AllSeen Alliance can innovate on top of the open framework and make real the vision of a simple, seamless experience that connects people to the things around them. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;
