    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em style=&quot;font-size:13.0080003738403px; line-height:1.538em&quot;&gt;Tim Kellogg (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kellogh&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@kellogh&lt;/a&gt;) is a Software Engineer &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%402lemetry&amp;amp;src=typd&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@2lemetry&lt;/a&gt; researching IoT protocols. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.2lemetry.com/&quot;&gt;2lem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.2lemetry.com/&quot;&gt;etry&lt;/a&gt; is an Internet of Things platform and solutions company that powers the connected enterprise, tying people, processes, data and devices together -- transforming raw data into real-time actionable intelligence. 2lemetry has developed a unique platform architecture that allows for native support of multiple protocols, and can even handle home-grown, proprietary or legacy protocols. By doing so, protocol interoperability at all levels is now possible&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:13.0080003738403px; line-height:1.538em&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://media.licdn.com/media/p/5/005/048/3a7/2f35815.png&quot; style=&quot;float:left; height:104px; margin:10px; width:300px&quot; /&gt;With the Internet of Things (IoT) being at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2819918&quot;&gt;the peak of the hype cycle&lt;/a&gt;, it can be hard to remember that IoT is just embedded devices connected to other computers. Of course, we&#039;ve been doing that for decades, and we&#039;re still getting stuck on the basics. I believe that AllJoyn provides a framework that makes developers release good quality work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&#039;s been countless disasters in embedded security over the years. In 2003, &lt;a href=&quot;http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/23.09.html#subj2&quot;&gt;there was an incident&lt;/a&gt; in which the brakes on some Mitsubishi busses could be disabled by dosing them with illegal levels of EMI radiation. Also, there was the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.securityfocus.com/news/6767&quot;&gt;Slammer Worm incident&lt;/a&gt; where a nuclear power plant lost access to their live feed of safety data when a hacker broke into their network through an unpatched version of SQL Server using a well documented vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bruce Schneier&#039;s classic &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2014/01/the_internet_of_thin.html&quot;&gt;essay about IoT security&lt;/a&gt; highlights an incident where a security researcher tested 30 home routers and broke into half of them by using well documented vulnerabilities that had been patched for many years. The culture of embedded developers at these router manufacturers has had a &quot;don&#039;t fix it if it&#039;s not broken&quot; philosophy in which security vulnerabilities don&#039;t seem to count as &quot;broken&quot; and needing to be fixed. When a new version of a router gets released, it might use mostly the same software as the previous year&#039;s model. Before long, brand new routers were being shipped with security vulnerabilities that had been fixed for five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So many of these horror stories have very simple fixes. In many cases, enhancing the software auto-update process would have nearly eliminated the problem. In other cases, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.autosec.org/pubs/cars-oakland2010.pdf&quot;&gt;a research project done at the University of Washington on modern automobiles&lt;/a&gt;, most components of a car were assumed to be trustworthy. This means that if an attacker was able to compromise innocuous components, such as the entertainment system, they could use that to compromise safety features inside the car. In the Internet of Things, it isn&#039;t acceptable to blindly trust other devices or components - even if you designed and built both of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I think about AllJoyn, I keep comparing it to how &lt;a href=&quot;http://rubyonrails.org/&quot;&gt;Ruby on Rails&lt;/a&gt; affected web development in the mid 2000&#039;s. Before Rails everyone had their own way of doing things and web developers regularly botched the job. &lt;a href=&quot;http://xkcd.com/327/&quot;&gt;SQL injection was commonplace&lt;/a&gt;, even in banking sites. When Rails showed up, it made it easy to make web applications that had generally good security, were easy to unit test and maintain, and looked good. I don&#039;t think it did any of these things perfectly, but it made it very easy to do the relatively well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AllJoyn is also an open source software framework that takes care of a lot of details that developers frequently do wrong. Of course, the challenges in connected IoT devices are a bit different, but AllJoyn also makes them easy to do right. For instance, we know that &lt;a href=&quot;http://wnss.sv.cmu.edu/papers/ciot-13.pdf&quot;&gt;manual configuration makes it difficult to scale&lt;/a&gt; to large fleets of devices, so AllJoyn provides auto-discovery features so that devices can infer information about their surroundings automatically. AllJoyn also makes it really easy and transparent to &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.qualcomm.com/blog/making-it-easy-devices-connect-%E2%80%93-alljoyn-security-framework&quot;&gt;secure an interface&lt;/a&gt;; so easy that I wonder why not make everything secure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything in the AllJoyn project points toward reuse and collaboration. Interfaces between devices are quickly being standardized - which makes it easy to quickly get up to speed and be productive with AllJoyn. I truly believe that AllJoyn is going to be a groundbreaking technology. It does a great job of putting developers on a path toward success and minimizes the possibilities to make the same mundane mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;
